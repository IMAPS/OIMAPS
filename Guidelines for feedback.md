Please find below indicative questions to base your feedback:

1. Do you agree with the items (questions) of the OIMAPS questionnaire (in terms of organisational behavioural interoperability)? (Yes/No | Rationale)

2. Do you have any changes to propose (e.g. additional options, terminology issues)? (Yes/No | Rationale)

3. Do you think that there is any item (question) missing? (Yes/No | Rationale)

4. IMAPS team suggests that item D10 does not need scoring, thus there are no recommendations for this item to the end-user. 
   Do you agree with this approach or do you think that item D10 needs scoring? (Yes/No | Rationale)

5. IMAPS team replaced the term 'capabilities' with the term 'means' in items D5 and C4. Previously, these items included the 'organisational capabilities' instead of the 'specifications of the means'. 
   However, with these questions we want to assess the capabilities of the digital public service to be discoverable by its end users or other services and in the service consumption section, to discover other services (for consumption).
    
   Which is more user-friendly? Do you have any suggestions? (Yes/No | Rationale)
   
 6. IMAPS team suggests to add an item related to the EIRA v3.1.0 ABB ‘Exchange of Business information’. Do you have any suggestions? (Yes/No | Rationale)
   
   Note: The EIRA ABB ‘Exchange of Business information’is the business capability on exchanging data, information, and Knowledge.

 7. IMAPS team suggests this item: "Are additional and context-specific possibilities for communication (e.g. contact form, chat) and/ or digital support (e.g. FAQ, chatbot) offered in your digital public service?". 
    Do you have any suggestions? (Yes/No | Rationale)
    
 8. IMAPS team suggests to move item D11 from IMAPS questionnaire ‘Can users give feedback on the quality of the digital public service?’ to OIMAPS questionnaire (and keep the same options). In this case, IMAPS team suggest to add to IMAPS questionnaire a more generic question such as ‘Are feedback and complaints from users taken into account for the further development and continuous revision of the digital public service?’
    What is your view on this? (Yes/No | Rationale)
